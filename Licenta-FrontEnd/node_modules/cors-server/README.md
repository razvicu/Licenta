## About
**cors-server** is a command line script that will start a web server on a given port that will proxy any request received and add CORS headers to it.

## Installation
Type `npm install -g cors-server` on the command line.

## Usage
To start the server simply call it from the command line and supply a port number
```shell
cors-server <port>
```

After that, any requests sent to http://localhost:[port] will have `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on the response.

e.g:
```
POST http://localhost:3005/http://www.google.com
```
